- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SoCodesNow
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Learning Python
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning from Basics and trying to relearn
- âš¡ Fun fact: I was a developer but i didn't enjoy it then and switched career.
     I am giving it a second chance to love coding in Python.
- What would be different this time? Well this time i am enjoying it and not stressed about the learning process and the outcome.
